A place to keep my project notes.
I am quite old and very forgetful.  It's handy to capture things I've learned or done somewhere I can find later on...  This is it.

## Sage II Computer Project
When I started out in computing, I worked for a company that assembled a Prestel Editting Terminal.  It was 6800 based and contained many amazing features; I was too dim to realise most of them!  Anyway, there were plans to re-engineer using the 6809 but the company went out of business before that went into production.  A the time I was reading about the 68000 which seemed beyond the reach of anyone in the world I knew.  I read about it, tried to understand it but never actually played with one.  Fast forward 30 years and a friend wanted help with a University project based on 68K so I dusted off my data sheets and built something to get him started.   I realised that I wanted to learn more and so started searching for some pre-built hardware...  Although you'd think I'd go for something VME based, I found the eco-system still expensive and quite daunting.  Anyway I found the Sage II Computer and I've been somewhat obsessed with it off-and-on ever since.

It arrived with some floppy disks (some unreadable) and internally there was a Pluto Graphics Board interface installed (but no actual Graphics Board I'm afraid).  That set in motion a tangent project which has not really got very far but produced some interesting information from the long distant past.
